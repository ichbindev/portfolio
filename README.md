# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. It's a simple business-card site built using Gatsby and React. You can visit it live on the web at [mlin.ac](https://www.mlin.ac)

## Running and Building

In your terminal, navigate to the root folder and run `yarn install` to install the dependencies, including Gatsby.

You can now run `yarn dev` or `gatsby develop` to spin up the project locally at [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

To build the site for deployment, simply run `gatsby build`.
